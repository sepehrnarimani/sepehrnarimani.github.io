In this we are tryng to find average of differnet values with different amounts. for example, we have 3 type of students. the average score of 18 `m` students is 20.the average score of `x` students is 18 and average score of `y` students is 16. to find the average of score in these situations, we can use this formula:
$$
(\sum_{k=1}^\infty x_k * f_k) / \sum_{k=1}^\infty f_k
$$
